# StarWars-Generator
This is a Star Wars character generator built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The web application has a simple interface wherein we have the application name, a basic welcome message, a picture and a button at the bottom. As soon as we click the button a random character information is displayed on the screen in the following format- a picture on the left and a bunch of information about the character on the right. We can press the button as many times as we want to display a character information.
